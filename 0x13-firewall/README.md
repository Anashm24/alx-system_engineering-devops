# firewall

## definition 

* A firewall is a system that provides network security by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of predefined rules.

* It acts as a guardian at the perimeter of your network, monitoring data packets as they attempt to enter or exit.

* Unlike antivirus software that scans devices and storage systems for threats that have already penetrated your defenses, a firewall focuses on traffic flow.
